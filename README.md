# NumericalImplicitization
A [Macaulay2](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/) package for user-friendly calculation of basic invariants of the image of a polynomial map. The computational techniques (interpolation, homotopy continuation and monodromy) come from numerical algebraic geometry.

This package is distributed with Macaulay2, since version 1.11. For the main package documentation page, see [here](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.12/share/doc/Macaulay2/NumericalImplicitization/html/).
